# 🔗 Simple URL Shortener

A “simple” URL shortener built by **Vibecoding**, using:

- 🧠 Gemini 2.5 Pro for AI pair programming
- ⚙️ Next.js (TypeScript)
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS for styling
- 🗃️ MongoDB for storing URLs
- ☁️ Firebase Studio for deployment and project management

This project may look small, but took an emotional toll far beyond its lines of code. Built through late-night debugging, existential dread, and the quiet hum of the terminal window.

---

## 🧠 Why?

> Because sometimes you just want to shorten a URL... and accidentally spiral into a coding-induced identity crisis.
